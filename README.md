### [Caravan Insurance Study - Logistic Regression](/R_Files/Caravan_Insurance_Study.R)

In this study, I was given a [dataset](/Data/Caravan.csv) that indicates whether owners purchased caravan insurance or not. This dataset also includes some demographic information about the owners. This study runs a logistic regression in order to see how these characteristics relate to the insurance buying decision of the caravan owners.
