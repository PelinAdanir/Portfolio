### [Telecom Work Measurement Study - OLS](/R_Files/Telecom_Work_Measurement_Study.R)
This model looks at some [telecom data](/Data/tel.csv) and evaluates different linear regression models that determines the relationship between the dependent variable of number of hours worked, and some independent variables. 

### [Caravan Insurance Study - Logistic Regression](/R_Files/Caravan_Insurance_Study.R)

In this study, I was given a [dataset](/Data/Caravan.csv) that indicates whether owners purchased caravan insurance or not. This dataset also includes some demographic information about the owners. This study runs a logistic regression in order to see how these characteristics relate to the insurance buying decision of the caravan owners.

### [Claims Study - Lasso Regression](R_Files/Claims_Study.R)

The [dataset](/Data/claims.zip) includes insurance claims severities from Allstate. After adjusting the dataset to show the claims of higher than $100, I ran an OLS regression with the full model. Next, with a Lasso regression, I have found the smallest mean-squared-error. Then with cross validation I found best lambda for the Lasso model.

### [Wine Data Study - Classification Tree Model](/R_Files/Wine_Data_Classification.R)

This study looks at a [Wine Data](/Data/winequality-red.csv) dataset that includes some features about the quality and characteristics of a variety of wines. The outcome variable is the quality of wines. This model aims to use a classification tree to find the most relevant set of features that can predict the wine quality the best.

### [Wine Data Study - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting](/R_Files/Wine_Data-random_forest-gradient_boosting.R)

Expanding on the classification tree from the previous study, this study makes a random forest model and then a gradient boosting model.
